1. For steam, if the command works but the icon doesn't:
  /usr/share/applications/steam.desktop and change the PrefersNonDefaultGPU=true to false
2. Apt completion. The apt-mint-linux thing is crap. Move it and its corresponding bash
   completion aside. apt seems to have an internal readline implementation or somethign.
